# Tracking Error
The tracking erros refers to funds, a lot of them are tryign to follow (or outperform) a benchmark index (say the performance of the S&P 500 index for instance), 
the trackign error is the difference between the benchmark index and the performance of the fund.

You do not want it to be to low or too high, while it may seem sgood that the fund overpeorms the index, if it islegally tied to it that means it will catch up the overperformance by underperforming ntil both are inline.
