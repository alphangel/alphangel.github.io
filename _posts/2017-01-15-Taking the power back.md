# Taking the power back
I've been working in the financial industry for the past 17 years, I started modelling financial models and risk scenarios for a software vendor.
Doing some consulting work for banks and hedge funds to end up CTO a a large hedge fund in Europe afer refusing a position as a volatility trader! I've seen a lot of the industry from various angles.

As you can guess, I heard a lot about investing and was privy to some interesting conversation but when it came to my own finance and investements I was hoplessly clueless...
Then one day after seeing the abysmal performance of the mandate that my bank had to mamange my wealth, I decided to take the power back and invest my own money myself gradually and despite all my knowledge I was unsure where to start (ETF, funds, stocks, bonds,  ...) what kind of portfolio to build (income, value, momentum, ...) an don which time frame what kind of management, active or passive...

My first instict was to build a portfolio and manage it in orde to lead to the highest possible performance! Easier said than done and it is very high maintenance... In the end, as is very often the case, it is all about the end game... Do I want to build my retirement fund? DO I want to generate additional income or make a living out of it?

I'm curious and I have an expriemntal mind so I started testing a gathering information abuot a lot of investment strategies subscribing to some investment advisory services some of which quite expensive, the price not necessarily being an indication of quality. I made mistkaes and I was sometime sot eager to test things, so I figured I woudl start implement en blog therapy, writing and documenting my investements guidelines and principles all the strategies I've tested so that I had somethig to go back, some frst principles when I'm in the process of making an investment.

This is this my attempt, with first principles we always go back to the why? So here today I will answer investment whys!
