# Why taking an interest in your finance is critical?

It boils down to [fees](/concepts/fees/) and [tracking errors](/concepts/tracking_error/).

Last year I had a conversation with my banker, it was the beginning of 2016 and the markets were crazy volatile. I was not too worried. My money that they were managing was invested in a safe combination of assets matching my risk profile: 60% of bonds and less than 40 percent of stocks.
so basically with markets down about 10% I was expecting to be down around 4 maybe a little more but anyway much less than the stock market. As I log onto my ebanking I notice that I'm basically down 12% and proceed to send an angry email to my banker demanding for explanation and a meeting.

 In a nutshell, he explained to me that because markets moved they had to [rebalance](/concepts/rebalancing/) funds and with the fees that explained the underperfomance...blah blah blah!
 I don't know about you but if I say I only want 40% or less exposure to an asset class I don't want technicalities in the way.. and no bullshit either.

## What's the issue with the fees
This was for me the wake up call that I had to take some interest in what was going on. The bank had a management mandate where they were investing my money in their selection of funds.
This service is however not free, they charge a little percentage of total asset value no matter what their performance is, it's called the management fee supposedly this covers the administrative burden of not doing much all year long!
Ok fair enough they do provide a service ... but the fund they invest in also take a management fee of 1 to 2% and a performance fee (should they perform!) and having worked in the industry the way it usually works is that the fund do charge 1 to 2% management fee and give a rebate (also known as a kickback in less pristine environments!) to the money manager... not you!

This means that best case scenario you have to make 1.5% to over 4% performance in some case to cover the fees.

Let's put that in perspective and compare over 5, 10 and 20 years the impact of different fees we will assume market performance of around 6% which is historically plausible!


|**Initial capital**|	100,000|
|Fees	|0.25%	|0.50%	|1%	|2%	|3%|
|After 5 years	| 132,252| 	 130,696| 	 127,628| 	 121,665| 	 115,927| 
|After 15 years	| 174,906| 	 170,814| 	 162,889| 	 148,024| 	 134,392| 
|After 20 years	| 305,920| 	 291,776| 	 265,330| 	 219,112| 	 180,611| 
|After 30 years	| <span style="background-color:lightgreen">**535,071**</span>| 	 498,395| 	 432,194| 	 324,340| 	 <span style="background-color:red">**242,726**</span>|

Now that means that when you retire, you may face yourself with only half the money you would have add ahd you invested in a simple ETF for some sort of tracker for the stock market.

I should just stop here, if you are not yet convinced you should go back to your banker's website!

## Rebalacing what???
Now rebalancing is very common ... As per investment guidelines, you are to be exposed a maximum of 20% technology, 10% financial sectors or a maximum of 25% to Europe, this depends on the funds/mandates. However, depending on how it is down this can have a terrible effect on your finance, let's review:
- some funds have entry fee/exit fees, so rebalancing takes a toll on your performance again
- if a sector region is doing very well, by rebalancing, you are cutting its upside to move it back to less performing asset classes, this is one of the primary reason why rebalancing should be done very little no more than once a year and ideally not on the 31st of December as everybody does it and this can skew he rebalancing itself!
- Now what happened to me, is the worst case, some regions were doing poorly and volatility was very high so they decided to move asset to a less volatile asset class from equity to bonds but after most of the damage happened which ended up affecting the recovery of my portfolio as I was no longer as much exposed to the equity markets which recovered after February 2016 and I ended up paying huge fund fees

In a nutshell you need to make sure you understand the mechanics of rebalancing your portfolio, rebalancing itself is not a bad thing, an asset class that goes up a lot will eventually go back down and if it goes down 50% you need 100 performance to recover, so rebalancing helps to take profit. SO how do you do it? well it will be the in-depth topic of another post but basically, you don't try to time the market and do it at a maximum of twice a year if the balance between asset class has really changed and at fixed date which will save you from the pitfall of "timing" the market, if you knew how to do that you would not need to rebalance, you could just play the market at will and be rich beyond your wildest dreams!!!


To wrap up, nowadays there is a raised awareness about those issues but unless you're an expert, it is still nearly impossible to figure out how much money goes out the window!
There are a number of robo-advisors and low cost broker that are trying to tackle this issue, I believe a fair amount of them are orders of magnitude better than delegating it to a "traditional" banker and I plan on doing a review  but the truth is.
ti is not that hard to build your investment portfolio following some simple guidelines but this is the topic a future post!
