So today my brother who just finished a big contract is finally deciding to put some money aside. He knows very little about investments and asked for my advice...
I told him about fees about taxes implications (those actually vary a lot from one country to another and he lives in a country with almost no taxes!) and so on. 

The solution is not as trivial as it sounds but as of today beginning of 2017, I plan on building him a suggestion of a small portfolio 50% USD / 50% EUR as he is paid in $ but he often comes back to Europe where his kids will probably study one day to promote a bit of growth on top of capital preservation with very little active management.

I could have spent hours trying to screen for ETF and CEF and analyzing correlations but decided to use a few robo-advisor out there and see if I could piggy back on it.

So let's take a look (I have no affiliation with any of the services/websites mentioned):

We see that basically the difference between high and low risk is the proportion of "safe" bonds where your capital is mostly protected, high yield bonds where your capital is less risky than stocks but yields a few percent a year and then stocks, the spread between emerging markets, Europe and North America varies based on the origin of the service provider, Wealthfront is US based so of course anything non USD is more risky and LIQID and VAMOO are German.

I want to reiterate a comment here. If you are really bored with finance and really do not feel comfortable dealing with the emotional risk and uncertainty of the market then robo-advisors are a good choice, make sure you review fees,  total [AUM (asset under management)](/concepts/aum/) as you want to free up your mind to work on other project which may be more lucrative for you! And that's totally fine but if it just down to laziness realize that spending 1 hour a year to review your passive investment could save you .25% to .50% for those advisers and after 30 years that's going to cost you 20 to 40 percent of your assets/retirement funds... that may be worth a few minutes of your time ;-)

## Asset classes
Now let's review the different asset classes and my opinion on them at the moment:
